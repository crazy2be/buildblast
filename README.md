Experiments
-----------------
If you want to try out something hard, and possibly impossible, attempt one of these:
- Change the network protocol to have unreliable delivery semantics for certain types of packets, namely player-position and entity-position packets (which are sent a LOT). WebRTC might help here.
- Make a more efficient mesher that doesn't result in visual artifacts (a naïve [greedy mesher](http://0fps.wordpress.com/2012/07/07/meshing-minecraft-part-2/) seems to produce artifacts on cheaper cards. Might be avoidable somehow.)
