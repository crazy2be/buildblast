This folder contains meshing benchmarking tools.

Run

	node node-main.js

To get a rough idea of how fast the meshing is.

Run

	go run run.go
	google-chrome http://localhost:8000/

to have the meshing code (and just the meshing code) running, which you can
then easily profile using the chrome developer tools.
